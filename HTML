        <p>Ever feel like gravity is holding you back? With EzHang, we said, "Nah," and mounted a chair to the ceiling instead.</p>
        <p>Why sit normally when you can defy physics? Whether you're an adventurer, a thrill-seeker, or just someone tired of conventional furniture, EzHang is your ticket to an elevated experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> May cause excessive fun, jealous friends, and an overwhelming urge to never sit the right way up again.</p>
